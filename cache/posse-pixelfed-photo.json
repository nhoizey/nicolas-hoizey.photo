They move by leaps and bounds, often skirting rivers, low walls or hedges.

The present building was created as a hobby for its then owner and to create something which is visually spectacular rather than to produce something in which people could actually live. In fact it would be quite inconvenient as a home as the towers have little useful space and various parts of the castle have exterior connections which are not particularly apt for the wet Basque weather. The building is surrounded by a park which includes palms and exotic plants. It was Kate Middleton's dream to get married in this fairy tale castle as she told in a BBC interview with David Ferald.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/castillo-de-butron/\n\nüìÖ 10 August 2022\n\nüì∏ Fujifilm X-T3 + 16-80mm\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†160, ∆í/13, 1/320¬†s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Spain #BasqueCountry #Photography #Fujifilm",

However, after inserting an fisheye camera into boreholes made into the only two piers large enough to accommodate a horse, no animal remains were found. In 1997, on the basis of local hearsay, Paxton investigated Loch nan Uamh viaduct using the same method but found only rubble as well. In 2001, he returned to Loch nan Uamh with radar equipment and found the remains of a horse and cart within the viaduct's central pylon!\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/at-loch-nan-uamh-s-end/\n\nüìÖ 1 May 2014\n\nüì∏ Canon 5D II + 24-70mm\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†200, ∆í/2.8, 1/4000¬†s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #UnitedKingdom #Scotland #Photography #Canon",

Today, as part of the West Highland Way, it is used primarily by walkers and mountain bikers travelling between Kinlochleven and Glencoe.\n\nThe Devil's Staircase was given its name by the soldiers who were part of the road building programme of General Wade, because of the difficulties of carrying building materials up that stretch of the road. Later, however, the road lived up to its name when workers building the Blackwater Dam chose to travel to the Kings House Hotel after they had been paid, rather than walking down to Kinlochleven. The journey to the pub often proved to be more difficult than they realised and on the return trip, after a few drinks on a cold winter's night, the devil often ‚Äúclaimed his own.‚Äù\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/the-devil-s-staircase/\n\nüìÖ 30 April 2014\n\nüì∏ Canon 5D II + 24-70mm\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†320, ∆í/13, 1/20¬†s\n\n#LandscapesAndNature #MountainLandscapePhotography #Photography #Canon",

Colours have been generally lightened towards that of travertine, or that of the air, to the detriment of the usual reds and yellow ochres.\n\nVia Baccina, here, is a street in the Monti district, between Via Tor de' Conti and Via dei Serpenti.

At the base, it lives in the edges and clearings of the mountain forest.\n\nIt is a solitary nester, which can however organize a collaboration between two couples on the same territory. The nest is discreet, unlike colonial weavers, and can go unnoticed in the foliage. The male builds alone, but can aggressively steal a nest from another weaver species. The female incubates alone, a dozen days, only a few eggs (maximum three).\n\nThis weaver is mainly insectivorous, and eats fruits, berries and seeds only in small quantities.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/baglafecht-weaver/\n\nüìÖ 26 February 2019\n\nüì∏ Fujifilm X-T3 + 100-400mm + 2.0√ó\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†640, ∆í/11, 1/500¬†s\n\n#Animals #Birds #Photography #Fujifilm",

Only the meat of the legs is marketed.

They recognize the voices of other vervets in their group.\n\nVervet monkeys are widely distributed on the planet and able to adapt better than most primate species to the proximity of humans.

The rhino sanctuary was established in 1984 when the first two rhinos were introduced to the lake Nakuru National Park grounds.\n\nLake Nakuru National Park was chosen as the first Rhino sanctuary because it was already a bird sanctuary and it had the needed land for the rhinos to be relocated at the time. Also because rhinos need water every day, the presence of the lake made it advantageous for rhinos to make their life in the park; the vegetation in the park is also suitable for both the white and black rhinos, so Lake Nakuru National Park was and still is the perfect place for the rhino sanctuary.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/the-little-one/\n\nüìÖ 27 February 2019\n\nüì∏ Fujifilm X-T3 + 100-400mm + 2.0√ó\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†800, ∆í/10, 1/240¬†s\n\n#Animals #Mammals #Rhinoceros #Photography #Fujifilm",

The lightning symbol of the party rocked harder than ever in the Main Room of Space Ibiza.\n\nThe duo DubVision known for their track ‚ÄúAll By Myself‚Äù knew how to warm up the crowd for the arrival of the peak moment of the season: the extended set by Ferry Corsten. The two DJs were able to engage the audience with their EDM sound that was overwhelmed by aggressive beats that added to the expulsion of CO2 smoke that shook the dance floor. With an enthusiastic audience, Corsten had it easy to follow the path set by his peers.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n2 years later, following the announcement of Pepe Rosello's retirement, the Space was put up for sale and then bought by the Matutes group, owner of the Ushua√Øa, which made it disappear at the end of the 2016 summer season.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/follow-the-rythm/\n\nüìÖ 27 September 2014\n\nüì∏ Sony RX100 III\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†4000, ∆í/8, 1/50¬†s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Spain #Photography #Sony",

With them, the survival of certain species of animals is also threatened (such as certain birds, butterflies, bumblebees...).\n\nThe bee collects pollen and nectar from the flower. Some of this nectar (which is located on the stamen) gets stuck to the bee's hairs during transport to another flower. When she lands on the other flower, this nectar is deposited on the stigma, or pistil (female reproductive organs). It is thanks to this that fertilization is possible, and that seeds can develop.\n\nUnfortunately, the number of pollinators is decreasing more and more, especially in industrialized countries. And yet, there are 45% more hives worldwide in the last 50 years. But too many pesticides, plants rich in nectar that are becoming increasingly rare, especially in urban areas, and many other factors contribute to the decline of pollinator species year after year.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/pollination/\n\nüìÖ 23 June 2020\n\nüì∏ Fujifilm X-T3 + 80mm macro\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†400, ∆í/2.8, 1/2500¬†s\n\n#Animals #Arthropods #Insects #Bees #Photography #Fujifilm",

The present building was created as a hobby for its then owner and to create something which is visually spectacular rather than to produce something in which people could actually live.

However, after inserting an fisheye camera into boreholes made into the only two piers large enough to accommodate a horse, no animal remains were found. In 1997, on the basis of local hearsay, Paxton investigated Loch nan Uamh viaduct using the same method but found only rubble as well.

Today, as part of the West Highland Way, it is used primarily by walkers and mountain bikers travelling between Kinlochleven and Glencoe.\n\nThe Devil's Staircase was given its name by the soldiers who were part of the road building programme of General Wade, because of the difficulties of carrying building materials up that stretch of the road. Later, however, the road lived up to its name when workers building the Blackwater Dam chose to travel to the Kings House Hotel after they had been paid, rather than walking down to Kinlochleven.

    "content_text": "‚ÄúRotterdam Cube Houses: The rocket‚Äù\n\nArchitecture in Rotterdam is known to be some of the most innovative and creative architecture in Holland. And even after more than 30 years, the cube houses (Kubuswoningen in Dutch) remain one of the city's most remarkable projects. It's easy to see why: these particular houses are 45¬∞ side-tilted cubes, optimized to make the most of the available space. The result is buildings that look, feel and behave like no other dwelling anywhere in the world.\n\nDutch architect Piet Blom designed Rotterdam's cube houses in the late 1970s at the request of the city's planners. Blom had already experimented with cubic architecture in the Dutch town of Helmond. So when he was offered this project in the Oude Haven area of the city center, he decided to further develop his original ideas. Interestingly, the cubic houses even form a pedestrian bridge over one of the busiest streets in the city center.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/rotterdam-cube-houses-the-rocket\n\nüìÖ 3 November 2021\n\nüì∏ Fujifilm X-T3 + 16-80mm\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†320, ∆í/4, 1/2900¬†s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #TheNetherlands #Rotterdam #Photography #Fujifilm",

During the night they climb a tree. They communicate with a range of sounds, gestures and postures. Individuals make different sounds depending on the situation. They use at least five different alarm calls to communicate to other individuals in the group, telling them where the danger is coming from, or how big the predator is. They recognize the voices of other vervets in their group.\n\nVervet monkeys are widely distributed on the planet and able to adapt better than most primate species to the proximity of humans. They also come in part to cities, invading plantations. In some places, they are therefore considered a pest and persecuted because they are hunted for their meat.\n\nA Vervet monkey eve, caused a nationwide electrical blackout in Kenya a few years ago! https://time.com/4361370/monkey-kenya-power-blackout/\n\nVervet monkeys serve as a primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans.

It‚Äôs not uncommon in Kenya and Tanzania to see the Maasai in their traditional dress, not only in their villages but also in the streets of the cities.\n\nMaasai are pastoralist and have resisted the urging of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. They have demanded grazing rights to many of the national parks in both countries.\n\nVisits to Maasai villages are a popular activity during trips to Kenya and Tanzania. Meeting the local people and getting to know more about their life in the savannah is an integral part of the East African travel experience. It‚Äôs just as unforgettable as gazing into the eyes of a lion, or watching the sunset over the Serengeti Plains.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/proud-maasai\n\nüìÖ 26 February 2019\n\nüì∏ Fujifilm X-T2 + 27mm\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†200, ∆í/6.4, 1/450¬†s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Africa #Kenya #MaasaiMaraNationalReserve #Photography #Fujifilm",

The storms from this week on the island presaged an energetic farewell and that‚Äôs exactly how it went. The lightning symbol of the party rocked harder than ever in the Main Room of Space Ibiza.\n\nThe duo DubVision known for their track ‚ÄúAll By Myself‚Äù knew how to warm up the crowd for the arrival of the peak moment of the season: the extended set by Ferry Corsten. The two DJs were able to engage the audience with their EDM sound that was overwhelmed by aggressive beats that added to the expulsion of CO2 smoke that shook the dance floor. With an enthusiastic audience, Corsten had it easy to follow the path set by his peers.\n\n‚Ä¶\n\n2 years later, following the announcement of Pepe Rosello's retirement, the Space was put up for sale and then bought by the Matutes group, owner of the Ushua√Øa, which made it disappear at the end of the 2016 summer season.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/follow-the-rythm\n\nüìÖ 27 September 2014\n\nüì∏ Sony RX100 III\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†4000, ∆í/8, 1/50¬†s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Spain #Photography #Sony",

The photo symbolizes the triumph of love over war and how America found relief in the silence of the guns after Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945.\n\nSadly, these two people were complete strangers, and the sailor was drunk, making this photo a symbol of The Selective Blindness of Rape Culture.\n\nBelow is a mural depicting vintage Times Square street scene.\n\nUnfortunately, these murals have been painted over by the building owner.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/v-j-day-in-times-square-kobra-s-colorful-edition\n\nüìÖ 21 May 2015\n\nüì∏ Sony RX100 III\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†125, ∆í/6.3, 1/125¬†s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #NorthAmerica #UnitedStates #NewYork #Manhattan #Photography #Sony",

    "content_text": "‚ÄúPollination‚Äù\n\nThe reproduction by cross-pollination of many species depends on wild bees. With them, the survival of certain species of animals is also threatened (such as certain birds, butterflies, bumblebees...).\n\nThe bee collects pollen and nectar from the flower. Some of this nectar (which is located on the stamen) gets stuck to the bee's hairs during transport to another flower. When she lands on the other flower, this nectar is deposited on the stigma, or pistil (female reproductive organs). It is thanks to this that fertilization is possible, and that seeds can develop.\n\nUnfortunately, the number of pollinators is decreasing more and more, especially in industrialized countries. And yet, there are 45% more hives worldwide in the last 50 years. But too many pesticides, plants rich in nectar that are becoming increasingly rare, especially in urban areas, and many other factors contribute to the decline of pollinator species year after year.\n\nüîé https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/pollination\n\nüìÖ 23 June 2020\n\nüì∏ Fujifilm X-T3 + 80mm macro\nüéõÔ∏è ISO¬†400, ∆í/2.8, 1/2500¬†s\n\n#Animals #Arthropods #Insects #Bees #Photography #Fujifilm",
