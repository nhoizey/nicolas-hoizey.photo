She quickly returned to the shelter.\n\nBy the time I got out my second camera, with a telephoto lens, she pleasantly surprised me by coming out, no doubt to see what olibrius had surprised her as she went hunting. I only had time to take 3 photos, including this one, where she graced me with a beautiful pose.\n\nStoats spend four to five hours a day hunting. They move by leaps and bounds, often skirting rivers, low walls or hedges. It also has a habit of standing up on its hind legs to see farther.\n\nI only found out later that this camera was configured for JPEG and not RAW, and I hadn't had time to set a faster shutter speed. The photo is blurry, but I managed to get a shot of an stoat, so it's not too bad.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/equally-surprised/\n\n📅 16 October 2023\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T3 + 100-400mm\n🎛️ ISO 160, ƒ/8, 1/160 s\n\n#Animals #Mammals #Photography #Fujifilm",

The present building was created as a hobby for its then owner and to create something which is visually spectacular rather than to produce something in which people could actually live. In fact it would be quite inconvenient as a home as the towers have little useful space and various parts of the castle have exterior connections which are not particularly apt for the wet Basque weather. The building is surrounded by a park which includes palms and exotic plants. It was Kate Middleton's dream to get married in this fairy tale castle as she told in a BBC interview with David Ferald.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/castillo-de-butron/\n\n📅 10 August 2022\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T3 + 16-80mm\n🎛️ ISO 160, ƒ/13, 1/320 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Spain #BasqueCountry #Photography #Fujifilm",

However, after inserting an fisheye camera into boreholes made into the only two piers large enough to accommodate a horse, no animal remains were found. In 1997, on the basis of local hearsay, Paxton investigated Loch nan Uamh viaduct using the same method but found only rubble as well. In 2001, he returned to Loch nan Uamh with radar equipment and found the remains of a horse and cart within the viaduct's central pylon!\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/at-loch-nan-uamh-s-end/\n\n📅 1 May 2014\n\n📸 Canon 5D II + 24-70mm\n🎛️ ISO 200, ƒ/2.8, 1/4000 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #UnitedKingdom #Scotland #Photography #Canon",

Today, as part of the West Highland Way, it is used primarily by walkers and mountain bikers travelling between Kinlochleven and Glencoe.\n\nThe Devil's Staircase was given its name by the soldiers who were part of the road building programme of General Wade, because of the difficulties of carrying building materials up that stretch of the road. Later, however, the road lived up to its name when workers building the Blackwater Dam chose to travel to the Kings House Hotel after they had been paid, rather than walking down to Kinlochleven. The journey to the pub often proved to be more difficult than they realised and on the return trip, after a few drinks on a cold winter's night, the devil often “claimed his own.”\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/the-devil-s-staircase/\n\n📅 30 April 2014\n\n📸 Canon 5D II + 24-70mm\n🎛️ ISO 320, ƒ/13, 1/20 s\n\n#LandscapesAndNature #MountainLandscapePhotography #Photography #Canon",

They communicate with a range of sounds, gestures and postures. Individuals make different sounds depending on the situation. They use at least five different alarm calls to communicate to other individuals in the group, telling them where the danger is coming from, or how big the predator is. They recognize the voices of other vervets in their group.\n\nVervet monkeys are widely distributed on the planet and able to adapt better than most primate species to the proximity of humans. They also come in part to cities, invading plantations. In some places, they are therefore considered a pest and persecuted because they are hunted for their meat.\n\nA Vervet monkey eve, caused a nationwide electrical blackout in Kenya a few years ago! https://time.com/4361370/monkey-kenya-power-blackout/\n\nVervet monkeys serve as a primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans.

The recent rises, though, are directly associated with above-average rainfall. The lakes have been even higher in the past, and with rainfall in the Rift Valley Basin being on a rising rainfall trend, higher lake levels can be expected in the future.\n\nLakes Nakuru, Bogoria, and Baringo have risen to their highest levels in decades, inundating roads and building infrastructure, yet they also are not as high as they were in the early part of the last century.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/sunset-on-lake-nakuru-s-flooded-trees/\n\n📅 27 February 2019\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T2 + 27mm\n🎛️ ISO 200, ƒ/3.2, 1/680 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Africa #Kenya #LakeNakuruNationalPark #Photography #Fujifilm",

It’s not uncommon in Kenya and Tanzania to see the Maasai in their traditional dress, not only in their villages but also in the streets of the cities.\n\nMaasai are pastoralist and have resisted the urging of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. They have demanded grazing rights to many of the national parks in both countries.\n\nVisits to Maasai villages are a popular activity during trips to Kenya and Tanzania. Meeting the local people and getting to know more about their life in the savannah is an integral part of the East African travel experience.

The storms from this week on the island presaged an energetic farewell and that’s exactly how it went. The lightning symbol of the party rocked harder than ever in the Main Room of Space Ibiza.\n\nThe duo DubVision known for their track “All By Myself” knew how to warm up the crowd for the arrival of the peak moment of the season: the extended set by Ferry Corsten. The two DJs were able to engage the audience with their EDM sound that was overwhelmed by aggressive beats that added to the expulsion of CO2 smoke that shook the dance floor. With an enthusiastic audience, Corsten had it easy to follow the path set by his peers.\n\n…\n\n2 years later, following the announcement of Pepe Rosello's retirement, the Space was put up for sale and then bought by the Matutes group, owner of the Ushuaïa, which made it disappear at the end of the 2016 summer season.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/follow-the-rythm/\n\n📅 27 September 2014\n\n📸 Sony RX100 III\n🎛️ ISO 4000, ƒ/8, 1/50 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Spain #Photography #Sony",

With them, the survival of certain species of animals is also threatened (such as certain birds, butterflies, bumblebees...).\n\nThe bee collects pollen and nectar from the flower. Some of this nectar (which is located on the stamen) gets stuck to the bee's hairs during transport to another flower. When she lands on the other flower, this nectar is deposited on the stigma, or pistil (female reproductive organs). It is thanks to this that fertilization is possible, and that seeds can develop.\n\nUnfortunately, the number of pollinators is decreasing more and more, especially in industrialized countries. And yet, there are 45% more hives worldwide in the last 50 years. But too many pesticides, plants rich in nectar that are becoming increasingly rare, especially in urban areas, and many other factors contribute to the decline of pollinator species year after year.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/pollination/\n\n📅 23 June 2020\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T3 + 80mm macro\n🎛️ ISO 400, ƒ/2.8, 1/2500 s\n\n#Animals #Arthropods #Insects #Bees #Photography #Fujifilm",

The present building was created as a hobby for its then owner and to create something which is visually spectacular rather than to produce something in which people could actually live. In fact it would be quite inconvenient as a home as the towers have little useful space and various parts of the castle have exterior connections which are not particularly apt for the wet Basque weather. The building is surrounded by a park which includes palms and exotic plants. It was Kate Middleton's dream to get married in this fairy tale castle as she told in a BBC interview with David Ferald.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/castillo-de-butron\n\n📅 10 August 2022\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T3 + 16-80mm\n🎛️ ISO 160, ƒ/13, 1/320 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Spain #BasqueCountry #Photography #Fujifilm",

However, after inserting an fisheye camera into boreholes made into the only two piers large enough to accommodate a horse, no animal remains were found. In 1997, on the basis of local hearsay, Paxton investigated Loch nan Uamh viaduct using the same method but found only rubble as well. In 2001, he returned to Loch nan Uamh with radar equipment and found the remains of a horse and cart within the viaduct's central pylon!\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/at-loch-nan-uamh-s-end\n\n📅 1 May 2014\n\n📸 Canon 5D II + 24-70mm\n🎛️ ISO 200, ƒ/2.8, 1/4000 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #UnitedKingdom #Scotland #Photography #Canon",

Today, as part of the West Highland Way, it is used primarily by walkers and mountain bikers travelling between Kinlochleven and Glencoe.\n\nThe Devil's Staircase was given its name by the soldiers who were part of the road building programme of General Wade, because of the difficulties of carrying building materials up that stretch of the road. Later, however, the road lived up to its name when workers building the Blackwater Dam chose to travel to the Kings House Hotel after they had been paid, rather than walking down to Kinlochleven. The journey to the pub often proved to be more difficult than they realised and on the return trip, after a few drinks on a cold winter's night, the devil often “claimed his own.”\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/the-devil-s-staircase\n\n📅 30 April 2014\n\n📸 Canon 5D II + 24-70mm\n🎛️ ISO 320, ƒ/13, 1/20 s\n\n#Landscape #LandscapePhotography #Photography #Canon",

Colours have been generally lightened towards that of travertine, or that of the air, to the detriment of the usual reds and yellow ochres.\n\nVia Baccina, here, is a street in the Monti district, between Via Tor de' Conti and Via dei Serpenti. The street owes its name to the Florentine family Baccini, who had their palace here, built by Andrea Baccini, who died in 1614.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/warm-colors-of-rome\n\n📅 11 May 2017\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T2 + 10-24mm\n🎛️ ISO 200, ƒ/4, 1/100 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Italy #Rome #Photography #Fujifilm",

They communicate with a range of sounds, gestures and postures. Individuals make different sounds depending on the situation. They use at least five different alarm calls to communicate to other individuals in the group, telling them where the danger is coming from, or how big the predator is. They recognize the voices of other vervets in their group.\n\nVervet monkeys are widely distributed on the planet and able to adapt better than most primate species to the proximity of humans. They also come in part to cities, invading plantations. In some places, they are therefore considered a pest and persecuted because they are hunted for their meat.\n\nA Vervet monkey eve, caused a nationwide electrical blackout in Kenya a few years ago! https://time.com/4361370/monkey-kenya-power-blackout/\n\nVervet monkeys serve as a primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans.

Kenya’s eastern Rift Valley has a string of eight lakes.\n\nThe Rift Valley is subject to ongoing plate tectonics and crustal movement that can affect the lakes. The recent rises, though, are directly associated with above-average rainfall. The lakes have been even higher in the past, and with rainfall in the Rift Valley Basin being on a rising rainfall trend, higher lake levels can be expected in the future.\n\nLakes Nakuru, Bogoria, and Baringo have risen to their highest levels in decades, inundating roads and building infrastructure, yet they also are not as high as they were in the early part of the last century.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/sunset-on-lake-nakuru-s-flooded-trees\n\n📅 27 February 2019\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T2 + 27mm\n🎛️ ISO 200, ƒ/3.2, 1/680 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Africa #Kenya #LakeNakuruNationalPark #Photography #Fujifilm",

It’s not uncommon in Kenya and Tanzania to see the Maasai in their traditional dress, not only in their villages but also in the streets of the cities.\n\nMaasai are pastoralist and have resisted the urging of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. They have demanded grazing rights to many of the national parks in both countries.\n\nVisits to Maasai villages are a popular activity during trips to Kenya and Tanzania. Meeting the local people and getting to know more about their life in the savannah is an integral part of the East African travel experience.

The storms from this week on the island presaged an energetic farewell and that’s exactly how it went. The lightning symbol of the party rocked harder than ever in the Main Room of Space Ibiza.\n\nThe duo DubVision known for their track “All By Myself” knew how to warm up the crowd for the arrival of the peak moment of the season: the extended set by Ferry Corsten. The two DJs were able to engage the audience with their EDM sound that was overwhelmed by aggressive beats that added to the expulsion of CO2 smoke that shook the dance floor. With an enthusiastic audience, Corsten had it easy to follow the path set by his peers.\n\n…\n\n2 years later, following the announcement of Pepe Rosello's retirement, the Space was put up for sale and then bought by the Matutes group, owner of the Ushuaïa, which made it disappear at the end of the 2016 summer season.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/follow-the-rythm\n\n📅 27 September 2014\n\n📸 Sony RX100 III\n🎛️ ISO 4000, ƒ/8, 1/50 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #Europe #Spain #Photography #Sony",

The photo symbolizes the triumph of love over war and how America found relief in the silence of the guns after Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945.\n\nSadly, these two people were complete strangers, and the sailor was drunk, making this photo a symbol of The Selective Blindness of Rape Culture.\n\nBelow is a mural depicting vintage Times Square street scene.\n\nUnfortunately, these murals have been painted over by the building owner.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/v-j-day-in-times-square-kobra-s-colorful-edition\n\n📅 21 May 2015\n\n📸 Sony RX100 III\n🎛️ ISO 125, ƒ/6.3, 1/125 s\n\n#Travel #TravelPhotography #NorthAmerica #UnitedStates #NewYork #Manhattan #Photography #Sony",

    "content_text": "“Pollination”\n\nThe reproduction by cross-pollination of many species depends on wild bees. With them, the survival of certain species of animals is also threatened (such as certain birds, butterflies, bumblebees...).\n\nThe bee collects pollen and nectar from the flower. Some of this nectar (which is located on the stamen) gets stuck to the bee's hairs during transport to another flower. When she lands on the other flower, this nectar is deposited on the stigma, or pistil (female reproductive organs). It is thanks to this that fertilization is possible, and that seeds can develop.\n\nUnfortunately, the number of pollinators is decreasing more and more, especially in industrialized countries. And yet, there are 45% more hives worldwide in the last 50 years. But too many pesticides, plants rich in nectar that are becoming increasingly rare, especially in urban areas, and many other factors contribute to the decline of pollinator species year after year.\n\n🔎 https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/photos/pollination\n\n📅 23 June 2020\n\n📸 Fujifilm X-T3 + 80mm macro\n🎛️ ISO 400, ƒ/2.8, 1/2500 s\n\n#Animals #Arthropods #Insects #Bees #Photography #Fujifilm",
