This diorama is just a small glimpse of the vast amount of Iron Man models seen in the various movies of the Marvel universe, and reproduced with incredible detail in 1/6th size by Hot Toys Limited, one of the world's best manufacturers of collectible action figures, including iconic movie characters (Star Wars, Alien, Predator, Terminator, etc.), in Hong Kong.

If you have the chance to visit this amazing city, don't miss the Hot Toys Secret Base, a showroom hidden from the uninitiated in the 20th floor of a huge building, resembling the interior of a spaceship. It's also a store, but only a few models are for sale on the spot, as pre-bookings must be made sometimes more than a year in advance!

They even had the right to a subject on CNN : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1Dvl3RD3BM
