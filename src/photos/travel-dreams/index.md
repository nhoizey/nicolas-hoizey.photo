Possibly Africa’s most famous ethnic group, the Maasai people are semi-nomadic people located primarily in Kenya and Northern Tanzania.

According to their own oral history the Masai people originated in the Nile Valley in Northern Africa and migrated south around the 15th century with their cattle.

Once considered fierce warriors and feared by all tribes in the area, the Maasai lost much of their power in the 19th century.

The Maasai have now adopted a more sedentary lifestyle that includes growing and buying cultivated food.

Most of them don't travel anymore.
