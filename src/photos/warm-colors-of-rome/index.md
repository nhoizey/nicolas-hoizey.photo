Colour is an ongoing concern in Italy due to the economic benefits that can be obtained from the restoration and re-use of buildings at historical sites, and because of the deterioration of the construction materials used in facades.

The warm colours of Rome have unfortunately been modified to a considerable degree. Colours have been generally lightened towards that of travertine, or that of the air, to the detriment of the usual reds and yellow ochres.

Via Baccina, here, is a street in the Monti district, between Via Tor de' Conti and Via dei Serpenti. The street owes its name to the Florentine family Baccini, who had their palace here, built by Andrea Baccini, who died in 1614.
