Like other spiders in the subfamily Nephilinae, the red-legged golden orb-weaver spider can weave webs so strong that sometimes even birds and bats get caught.

It is a passive and harmless spider but its bite can be painful.

In adulthood, sexual dimorphism is particularly favourable to females. Its body can measure several centimetres (up to 13) while that of the male measures only about five millimetres on average. Both are present in this photograph.
