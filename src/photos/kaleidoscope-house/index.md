In its heyday, mosaic stained glass was a common architectural feature of Tbilisi. Sadly most examples have been lost to time – but there are a few buildings that still boast gorgeous rainbow windows.

One of Tbilisi’s most recognisable landmarks, the "Kaleidoscope House" has large multi-coloured glass windows on all three sides of its front stairway. When the afternoon sun hits at just the right angle, it paints a colourful pattern onto the stairs and wooden balustrades.
