I tried several shots of the Center, with various angles and longer or shorter exposures, and all of a sudden I saw these areas of color that stood out well from where I was (blue in the upper left, yellow in the lower left, red in the lower right), and I gave it a shot. I then enhanced the effect a bit in Lightroom, but the main thing came from the shot.

My main regret is that the staircase should be more centered, but there was if I remember correctly no color reminder further to the right, and cropping to center would reduce the colored areas on the left.
