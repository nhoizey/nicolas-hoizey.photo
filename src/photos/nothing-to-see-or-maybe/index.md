As we drove slowly through the large empty spaces of the Maasai Mara National Reserve, I was fortunate enough to perceive a spot of slightly different color in a small group of bushes.

It was difficult to really see what it was, luckily a little bit of photography gear material can help!

Do you want to zoom (a lot)? üòÅ
