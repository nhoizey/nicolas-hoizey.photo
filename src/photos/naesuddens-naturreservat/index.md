Näsudden nature reserve consists of a peninsula located in Stockholm's inner archipelago, surrounded by Täljöviken/Svinningeviken to the west and Tunafjärden to the northeast.

The peninsula is a beautiful part of the inner archipelago with its valuable cultural heritage and exciting flora and fauna.

Here you'll find mountains with great views, old-growth coniferous forest, riparian meadows and open moorland and pasture.

The area's mixed landscape means that many different plants and animals thrive here. There are coniferous trees, the Adam and Eve orchid, grasshopper warbler, thorn warbler and rosefinch, among others. You can also see great cormorants and sea eagles.
