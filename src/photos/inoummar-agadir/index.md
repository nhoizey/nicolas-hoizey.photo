The Inoummar agadir is the largest granary in the Western Anti-Atlas (576 huts), near Ait Baha, on the road from Agadir to Tafraoute.

The "igoudars" testify to an ancestral history and a secular tradition. Long preserved in time, they reflect a culture both architectural and societal. They are collective granaries in the form of citadels, mostly watched over by a "lamine", which literally means trustworthy man. They were used to store foodstuffs, crops of wheat, corn and barley, oil, jewelry and precious documents. Because of their fortified form, they constituted the ideal refuge and the reliable shelter of the foodstuffs and goods of the douar populations against the temptations of the brigands.
