This high and mid-mountain species, which descends at its lowest around 800 meters in Uganda and Kenya, is well adapted to degraded, agricultural and even urban environments. At the base, it lives in the edges and clearings of the mountain forest.

It is a solitary nester, which can however organize a collaboration between two couples on the same territory. The nest is discreet, unlike colonial weavers, and can go unnoticed in the foliage. The male builds alone, but can aggressively steal a nest from another weaver species. The female incubates alone, a dozen days, only a few eggs (maximum three).

This weaver is mainly insectivorous, and eats fruits, berries and seeds only in small quantities.
