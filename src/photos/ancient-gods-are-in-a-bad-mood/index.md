The Colosseum is an oval amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age.

It was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles including animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Roman mythology, and briefly mock sea battles.
