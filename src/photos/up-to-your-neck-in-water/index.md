This photo was taken under the bridge connecting Draveil to Juvisy, during the great flood of the Seine at the end of January 2018.

Long exposure of 1 minute and 40 seconds with a Nisi ND1000 filter on the Fujifilm X-T2 with the 10-24mm at 10mm open at f/16, and 200 ISO. I should have thought earlier about adding the ND8 so I could increase the duration and/or open a bit more.
