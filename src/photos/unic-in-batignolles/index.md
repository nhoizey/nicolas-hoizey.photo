At number 22 of Mstislav-Rostropovitch street in the new Clichy-Batignolles district of Paris, this "Unic" apartment building was designed by Chinese architect Ma Yansong in collaboration with French architect Christian Biecher.

Completed in 2019, it is 49 meters high and has 14 floors.

The undulating forms of the building are directly inspired by Asian culture terraces.
