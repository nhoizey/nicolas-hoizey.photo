Children love to play, and they don't need much in the way of accessories.

Here, we offer them a thousand sophisticated and expensive gifts, and they sometimes prefer to play with packing boxes...

Over there, in Kenya for example, they don't have the "chance" to have so many gadgets, they make do with what they have, and have a lot of fun!
