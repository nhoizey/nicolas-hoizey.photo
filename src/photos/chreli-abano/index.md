With its splendidly tiled mosque-like facade, Chreli-Abano (sometimes called Orbeliani Baths) is without a doubt the most iconic bathhouse in Tbilisi.

Tbilisi’s baths are very different to those in Istanbul, Budapest, or anywhere else.

The location for the city was chosen because of the natural hot springs that course underground (Tbilisi means "warm place"). Persian-Ottoman style bath houses were erected atop this geothermal playground,  most of them in Abanotubani, the Old Town’s iconic sulfur bath district.
