Mangroves are tropical trees or shrubs belonging to various species of angiosperms, able to thrive along marine shores in the tidal swing zone. 

They have generally adopted viviparity to propagate: the seeds, rather than risking being drowned or asphyxiated, germinate on the tree and it is young seedlings that detach from the mother tree to stick directly in the mud.
