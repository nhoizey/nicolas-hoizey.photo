The Statue of Liberty, in addition to being a very important monument of New York City, has become one of the symbols of the United States and represents more generally freedom and emancipation from oppression.

From its inauguration in 1886 until the Jet Age, the statue is the first vision of the United States for millions of immigrants, after a long crossing of the Atlantic Ocean.
