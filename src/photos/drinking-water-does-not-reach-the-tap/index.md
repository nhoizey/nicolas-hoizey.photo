Kenya is among the countries identified as having unsafe tap water. It is one of 187 countries in the world where tap water is considered unsafe.

Not surprisingly, the safest tap water is found in developed countries. Conversely, countries in Central America, Africa, Asia and the Middle East are considered high risk.

According to the World Health Organization, approximately 842,000 people die each year in the world from diarrhea due to poor drinking water, sanitation and hand hygiene.
