The Edward Youde Aviary (尤德觀鳥園) is a 3,000-square-metre (32,000 sq ft) aviary built over a natural valley at the southern corner of Hong Kong Park, which is located in Central at the bottom of the north eastern slope of Victoria Peak in Hong Kong. The Edward Youde Aviary, largest in Southeast Asia, is named after the late Sir Edward Youde, the Governor of Hong Kong from 1982 to 1986.

The valley is bounded by an east-facing slope fully covered with natural vegetation and a west-facing slope previously occupied by a barracks. It has a highest point of 46.5 metres (153 ft) and a lowest point of 30 metres (98 ft) above the valley floor.

This walk-through aviary features a collection of 600 birds representing 80 species indigenous to Southeast Asia, Indonesia, and New Guinea. Ground dwelling birds including pheasants, leafbirds, partridges, pigeons and thrushes.
