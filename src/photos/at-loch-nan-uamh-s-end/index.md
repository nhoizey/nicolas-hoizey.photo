The Loch nan Uamh Viaduct is a railway viaduct that carries the West Highland Line. 

The viaduct was built by Robert McAlpine, nicknamed "Concrete Bob" for his innovative use of mass concrete.

The viaduct crosses the Allt a' Mhama, or Mama Burn, just before it flows into Loch nan Uamh, a sea loch to the north of the Ardnish peninsula.

In 1987 Roland Paxton, from Heriot-Watt University, investigated the legend that a horse had fallen into a pier during construction of the Glenfinnan Viaduct in 1898 or 1899. However, after inserting an fisheye camera into boreholes made into the only two piers large enough to accommodate a horse, no animal remains were found. In 1997, on the basis of local hearsay, Paxton investigated Loch nan Uamh viaduct using the same method but found only rubble as well. In 2001, he returned to Loch nan Uamh with radar equipment and found the remains of a horse and cart within the viaduct's central pylon!
