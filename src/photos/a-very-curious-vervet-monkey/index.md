These primates are semi-terrestrial, which means that they can live on the ground as well as in the trees. During the night they climb a tree.  They communicate with a range of sounds, gestures and postures. Individuals make different sounds depending on the situation. They use at least five different alarm calls to communicate to other individuals in the group, telling them where the danger is coming from, or how big the predator is. They recognize the voices of other vervets in their group. 

Vervet monkeys are widely distributed on the planet and able to adapt better than most primate species to the proximity of humans. They also come in part to cities, invading plantations. In some places, they are therefore considered a pest and persecuted because they are hunted for their meat.

Vervet monkeys serve as a primate model for understanding genetic and social behaviors of humans. They have some human-like characteristics, such as hypertension, anxiety, and social and dependent alcohol use.
