The African Baobab is a multipurpose, drought resistant, wild fruit tree, endemic to arid and semi-arid lands of Sub-Saharan Africa. Baobab populations have been showing a lack of regeneration, and therefore causes concern for the species survival.

The tree’s pulp has more protein than breast milk, more vitamin C than oranges, more magnesium than spinach, more iron than red meat and more potassium than a banana. It has become a popular additive in reinforced foods.

Researchers believe baobab has the potential to become a major regional export commodity, with Southern and Eastern African regions capable of supplying 700,000 metric tonnes of baobab fruit a year.
