Many boats sail on Victoria Bay in Hing-Kong, but none of them are as spectacular as the <a href="https://aqualuna.com.hk/">Aqua Luna</a>, her red sails and small lights make her the most famous Chinese sailing boat in Hong Kong.

The Aqua Luna was built from scratch; it took a Hong Kong craftsman 18 months to construct using traditional shipbuilding methods under the supervision of a 73-year-old shipbuilder.
