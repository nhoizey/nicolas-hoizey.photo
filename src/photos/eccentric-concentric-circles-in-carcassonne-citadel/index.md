In the summer of 2018, the city of Carcassonne — a medieval fortress dating back to the Gallo-Roman period — celebrated its twentieth anniversary as a Unesco World Heritage Site by inviting Swiss artist Felice Varini to create an ephemeral work on the city's ramparts and towers.

The artist had glued strips of aluminum foil painted yellow on the stones, to form an anamorphosis: designed to be seen from a specific location, the strips then formed "eccentric concentric circles", title of the work.

A work amply photographed and shared on social networks, thus ensuring a renewed notoriety to the city. The work was then, as expected, dismantled.

But the bands left traces on the walls, where the concentric circles are finally still visible, in hollow, like the skin remained under a bathing suit all summer... They should leave gradually, but difficult to anticipate the time necessary.
