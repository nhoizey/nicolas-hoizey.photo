<a href="http://www.eduardokobra.com/">Eduardo Kobra</a> painted these stunning murals on 25th Street at 10th Avenue in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, New-York City.

The top mural takes inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Eisenstaedt">Alfred Eisenstaedt</a>’s iconic photo of a U.S. Navy sailor grabbing and kissing a nurse on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V-J_Day_in_Times_Square">V-J Day in Times Square</a> in New York City. The photo symbolizes the triumph of love over war and how America found relief in the silence of the guns after Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945.

Sadly, these two people were complete strangers, and the sailor was drunk, making this photo a symbol of <a href="ttps://cratesandribbons.com/2012/09/30/the-kissing-sailor-or-the-selective-blindness-of-rape-culture-vj-day-times-square/">The Selective Blindness of Rape Culture</a>.

Below is a mural depicting vintage Times Square street scene.

Unfortunately, <a href="http://newyorkcliche.com/2016/02/11/high-line-kiss-mural-eduardo-korba/">these murals have been painted over  by the building owner</a>.
