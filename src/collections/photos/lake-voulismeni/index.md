Lake Voulismeni is the town of Agios Nikolaos' sole claim to fame, and it is here that most of the tourist activity is concentrated. 

It's actually a former enclosed lake, now opened to the sea by a canal dug at the end of the 19th century. Its shape is quite circular. A pedestrian walkway runs partially around it, the end of which is rendered inaccessible by the presence of a cliff. Today, the lake has become the town's harbour, where the fishermen of Agios Nikolaos moor their small boats.

Every year, at midnight on Orthodox Easter, the town's inhabitants gather here to celebrate with a fireworks display.

Legend also has it that the goddess Athena bathed in this reputedly bottomless lake.
