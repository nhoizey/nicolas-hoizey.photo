The 39th International Athletics Meeting of Montgeron took place on Friday June 27, 2025 at the Stade Pierre de Coubertin, and was the occasion to see Pascal Martinot-Lagarde (a.k.a. PML) run the 110m hurdles one last time, finishing 3rd in the final with a time of 13“47.

With 12 international medals to his name among seniors, Pascal Martinot-Lagarde has notably held the French record in the 110m hurdles since 2014, set at 12“95. He also won the European title in 2018.

Since June 27, 2025, the Montgeron track has been named “Pascal Martinot-Lagarde”, a beautiful tribute from the club to the man who joined its athletics section in 2013.
