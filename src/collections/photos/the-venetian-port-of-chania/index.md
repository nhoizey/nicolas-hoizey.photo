Chania (also known as Hania), Crete's second largest city, lies along the island's northern coast.

The Venetian port of Chania, including the Venetian lighthouse, is one of the town's symbols and a favourite strolling spot for locals and visitors alike, with its arched shape surrounded by colourful Venetian-style houses.

It was originally built in the 14th century. It was soon abandoned because it was too shallow and too exposed to the strong north and west winds. From then on, the larger port of Heraklion was elevated to the status of Europe's most important port.

The Chania lighthouse differs from other lighthouses of its time, and its architecture is reminiscent of a minaret. It is 21 metres high, its beam can reach a distance of 7 miles, and it is one of the oldest lighthouses in Europe, if not the whole world.
