Sitia is a picturesque town situated on the northeastern edge of Crete, built in an amphitheater shape beside the sea in the Gulf of Sitia.

One of the least "touristy" parts of Crete, Sitia as a town, was built up in Venetian times, destroyed and later rebuilt by the Turks, with just a few signs of this history remaining. The region, however, still provides numerous clues and monuments to the area's early history.

European route E 75 starts in Sitia and ends in Vardø, Norway).
