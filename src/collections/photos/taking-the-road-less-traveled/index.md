It's worth noting that hire cars are not insured on all of Crete's unpaved roads, which adds a little more spice (not to mention stress) to this part of the journey though the Katharo plateau.

The Katharo plateau is an elevated plain in eastern Crete, in the Lassithi district, in the municipality of Agios Nikolaos.

It lies at an average altitude of 1,150 m, 300 m higher than the neighboring Lassithi plateau, 12 km to the west; both are part of the Dicte massif. A rugged 12 km-long track links the two plateaus, but is only passable by all-terrain vehicles. 😅

From Kritsa, access to the plateau is via a spectacular road, steep and winding but fairly wide and in good condition, where passing other vehicles is not a problem.

The plateau owes its name to the now-abandoned hamlet of Katharo; the word “καθαρός” means “pure, clean”, which is no usurpation, as the air and water are particularly pure on this plateau.
