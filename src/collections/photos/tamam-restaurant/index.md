The building where the restaurant is situated was built around 1400 AC by the Venetians to operate as a public bath, in 1645 the Turks invaded Chania and continued using the bath just with some architectonic alterations. The 'Hamam' (Turkish meaning steam bath) continued to operate till the Turks left Crete.

Tamam was founded in 1982 by a group of friends and its name was inspired by the similar sound music of hamam that led to tamam and its significane in Arabic languages meaning 'all good' seemed appropriate for the newborn restaurant.

The cuisine style of tamam is unchangable since the first pots put in the oven. Traditional Greek food with some Eastern oriented influences by the Ottoman cuisine and the broader Eastern Mediterranean region. Crete was a place conquered by many, Venetians, Egyptians, Turkish. Chania was a trade center for Jewish, Arabs, Europeans and everybody left a mark during the ages that could not leave the food habits untouched.
