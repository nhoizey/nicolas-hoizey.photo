The history of Sicily is vast, rich in history, legends and nostalgic nuances and the castles tell it in their vicissitudes.

From the Arab conquest to the Norman one, passing through the Spanish influences and the rich Sicilian Baroque. There are more than 200 castles, fortresses and strongholds on the island.

The Castle of Milazzo, also known as the Fortified Citadel of Milazzo, is a fortress located in the homonymous city in the province of Messina. It, and the whole area included in the enclosure of the Spanish walls, represents the largest fortified citadel existing in Sicily with an area of ​​7 hectares and 12,000 square metres occupied by buildings.

The fortified citadel is one of the few examples of military architecture in which there are still defensive systems created over the course of 10 centuries by those who ruled this territory.
