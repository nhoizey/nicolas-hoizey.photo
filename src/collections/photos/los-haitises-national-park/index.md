It's no coincidence that Los Haitises National Park has been dubbed the “Halong Bay of the Caribbean”. Located in the Bay of Samana, this little-known natural park is mainly discovered by sea, as it is very difficult to reach by road. It is made up of thick tropical forest, mangrove swamps and dozens of islets, some of which are covered in cactus.

One of the great attractions of this paradise is the largest mangrove area in the Caribbean, with species such as red mangrove and white mangrove. Cedar and mahogany trees, as well as orchids of various species, complete an extraordinary array of plants.

As for the fauna, you can't miss the huge number of birds that populate the national park, especially in Cayo de los Pájaros, a favorite haunt for species such as the gannet, pelican and parrot, among many others.
