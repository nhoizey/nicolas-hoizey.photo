The Citadel of Calvi stands proudly above the town, a breathtaking backdrop of rich history and heritage.

It invites you to stroll its cobbled streets and discover the world in which Christopher Columbus was born. You'll find the remains of the house where he was born.

Another reason why the Citadelle is so popular is its privileged geographical location. Perched on its rocky promontory, it offers a 360-degree panoramic view of the town, the marina and the mountains jutting out into the sea. Its cobbled streets and typical Genovese houses tell the story of the town in their own way.
