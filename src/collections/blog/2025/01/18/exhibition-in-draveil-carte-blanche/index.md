From January 18th to 26th, seven fellow photographers from the [Photo Club of Draveil](https://www.photo-club-draveil.fr/) and myself had the renewed opportunity to participate in an exhibition. The title was ‚ÄúCarte blanche‚Äù (I think this is also used in English ü§î), as each photographer could chose its own preferred theme.

Following the work started for previous exhibitions, I decided to continue exploring the world of **miniature photography**, where I want to show how our view of everyday objects can completely change when they are staged with small model railroad figures in HO scale (1/87).

Here are the 15 new photos I created and chose to exhibit this time:

{% gallery "the-walking-dead-bloodstains", "cds-are-cool-again", "the-great-cinemascope-car-chase", "bivouac-in-champignac", "climbing-mount-goosefish", "the-restoration-team", "a-mess-of-connectors", "summer-activities", "cutlery-skate-park", "old-school-builders", "egyptian-archeology", "donut-looting", "hurrah-for-the-winners", "haute-couture-demands-preparation", "old-camera-maintenance" %}
