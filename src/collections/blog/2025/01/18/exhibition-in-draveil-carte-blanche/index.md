From January 18th to 26th, seven fellow photographers from the [Photo Club of Draveil](https://www.photo-club-draveil.fr/) and myself had the renewed opportunity to participate in an exhibition. The title was ‚ÄúCarte blanche‚Äù (I think this is also used in English ü§î), as each photographer could chose its own preferred theme.

Following the work started for previous exhibitions, I decided to continue exploring the world of **miniature photography**, where I want to show how our view of everyday objects can completely change when they are staged with small model railroad figures in HO scale (1/87).

You can see the 15 new photos I created and chose to exhibit [in the dedicated gallery](/galleries/exhibitions/2025/01-carte-blanche/).
