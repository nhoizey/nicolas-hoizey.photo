Starting today, the list of photos in the second part of the homepage are the ones I **shared** the most recently, instead of the ones I **took** the most recently.

It makes much more sense because I don't necessarily share them in order, and I have a lot of photos I took years ago that I still want to share on my site.

Also, if you don't plan to come see the site every day (go figure! ðŸ˜…), I added [feeds](/feeds/) you can subscribe to in your favorite feed reader.

If you didn't understand this last sentence, I invite you to read [this page about feeds](https://aboutfeeds.com/).
