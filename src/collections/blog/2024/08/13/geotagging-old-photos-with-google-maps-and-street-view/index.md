You may have noticed that I started to share some [photos from Crete](/galleries/travels/europe/greece/crete/), the beautiful (and largest) Greek island.

In fact, these photos come from a travel we made almost 20 years ago! Need I specify that these photos were not geotagged at all? üòÖ

The fact is I really want all photos I share to be geotagged[^privacy], so they are shown on [the georgous map view](/map/).

[^privacy]: Unless they were taken in a private location I don't want to disclose, of course.

So as [I already did several times in the past](https://nicolas-hoizey.com/notes/2022/07/28/2/), I used my memory of the places, and I wandered through the Google Maps 3D view and Street View photos to find their location.

Just for [the nice city of Chania](https://nicolas-hoizey.photo/tags/chania/), I found 79 exact locations[^chania], to the meter. üòç

[^chania]: I won't share all of them here, just a few, but I like to already have the locations in my Lightroom library, I might share more later.

It took a few hours, I admit, but it was worth spending part of my vacation time on it!
