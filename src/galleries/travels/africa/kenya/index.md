Kenya has considerable land area devoted to wildlife habitats. The “Big Five” game animals of Africa, that is the lion, leopard, buffalo, rhinoceros, and elephant, can be found in Kenya and in the [Maasai Mara](./maasai-mara/) in particular. A significant population of other wild animals, reptiles, and birds can be found in the national parks and game reserves in the country.

The main tourist attractions are photo safaris through the 60 national parks and game reserves.
