title: Tsavo West National Park
---

This districtâ€™s well-watered, volcanic soil supports a good range of woodland and savannah habitats for the full panoply of Kenyan wildlife.

Following Kenyan independence in 1963, hunting was banned in the park and management of Tsavo was turned over to the authority that eventually became the Kenya Wildlife Service. Tsavo currently attracts photo-tourists from all over the world interested in experiencing the vastness of the wilderness and incredible terrain.
