title: Vallée de la Clarée

The Haute Vallée de la Clarée is a wild and magnificent setting above the village of Névache, in the Cerces massif (Hautes-Alpes). It's particularly beautiful in autumn, when the larch forests take on shimmering colors and the first snow has already whitened the surrounding peaks.

With a few friends from my Photo Club, I was able to discover this splendid valley in the best possible conditions by taking part in [a week-long photo course organized by Un Œil sur la Nature](https://www.unoeilsurlanature.com/project/stage-photo-lumiere-dautomne-dans-la-vallee-de-la-claree/), with photographer guide [Léo Gayola](https://www.natureauvol.com/). An unforgettable experience.
