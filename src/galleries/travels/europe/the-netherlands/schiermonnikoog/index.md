Schiermonnikoog is the smallest occupied island in the north of the Netherlands. It is a beautiful place to visit, with a lot of nature and a lot of peace. The island is car-free, and a National Park, so you can only get around by bike or on foot. The island is also known for its beautiful beaches (including the longest in Europe) and lighthouses.
